# Project Silver
This is a crappy & bad auth server, using PHP. It's a classical PHP (no POO) app.

Good luck on using this; you will have a bad time.
## DEV INFO
Don't use this. 

This thing doesn't have any maintenance intended anymore.

+ the service isn't really secure, and it doesn't have any future possible.
